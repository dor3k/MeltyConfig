# MeltyConfig 0.4
###### A program which allows you to edit Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code's config data files without the need to open up MBAA.exe to do so.

## Getting Started
1. Download the latest MeltyConfig release from https://github.com/dor3k/MeltyConfig/releases or compile the program yourself
- If you're unsure only download MeltyConfig.exe
2. Place the MeltyConfig.exe into the folder containing MBAA.exe or run it wherever you want and provide appropriate paths in MeltyConfig.ini
3. Run the program and press the appropriate button to edit whatever option you want
4. Insert the desired value and hit enter
5. After you're done close the program or choose Exit in the options menu for the program to close

**MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS NOT RUNNING WHEN YOU OPEN THE GAME AS THE GAME WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE FILES, INSTEAD LOADING DEFAULT VALUES**

MAKE SURE THE GAME IS NOT OPEN WHEN YOU ARE EDITING THE CONFIG FILES AS THE CHANGES MAY NOT SAVE
## Changelog 0.4
- Bugfixes
- Volume Options are now displayed and inputted in a logical way reflecting their in-game values instead of their internal ones
- Added the option to abort changing values
